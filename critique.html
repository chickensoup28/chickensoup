    <h2>Purpose and objective</h2>
        <P>The purpose of this visualization is to make the people of United States of America understand the impacts of lockdown and social distancing. To show how the country was impacted the article focuses on the jobs that people lost during this time and compares it to relative large scale events to paint clearer pictures.
        </P>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <P>The article is made for the people of America and it is for them to understand contextualise how grave and serious the issue is hence the comparative measures/units used in the visualisation are events etched in the memory of the people.
        </P>
        
        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <P>The visual language is clean and simple, elements of the bar graph have been used as a tool to convey and project the measure of seriousness of the issue. The highlight color 'Red' is chosen aptly to highlight important parts and draw attention of the reader towards them. Navigating to the visualizations further down in the scroll there is use of a line graph that provides even more persepective.  
        </P>
        <p>Once the overview of the narrative is done we move to details on demand. Here the data is broken down and simple use of glyphs to represent people and population is used. Comparative area covered is used to contextualise how much a sector has been affected. The same visual style is carried forward to the rest of the visualisations only with refernce to a unit figure. This is done to provide comparative analysis between equal quantitites.</p>

        <h2>Interaction and narrative design</h2>
        <p>The only interaction in the article is the scroll function and as the reader scrolls through the article the narrative is conveyed. The narrative is convedyed but intelligently using elements of the bar chart that emphasises on the point in hand. One of the long vertical bars is annotated and marked quantitatively at places with reference to either past events or a number which conveys how big and impactful the bar is. Once the conflict is stated it is expained further more by layering it with a line graph which further goes on to convey the point in the narrative. Once the idea is contextualised and expained the author goes into details to give further context and understanding of the situation where they zoom into sectors and impact on people via different lens. The article finishes abruptly once the details on demands end.</p>
    

        <h2>Effectiveness</h2>
        <P>Simple, srtaightforward and impactful. Puts forth a point and then justifies it with the help of charts that are easy to understand and grasp. A visualisation meant for the masses. This falls aptly in place because the article is meant to be consumed by people from all walks of life. There is no need to decode metaphors or read legends when the story is presented loud and clear. 
        </P>

        <h2>What if?</h2>
        <P>I feel the narrtive is put forth very effectively and to the point. There is conflict, a body but no resolution in this case which is fine because the article only meant to state facts and make people aware of the scenario but the lack of reolution leads to the article falling flat towards the end. 
            </P>
        <p>
      The article and the narrative holds up really well but then ends abruptly only to find the reader scrolling for more. Only if there was some meat and conclusion to the facts that have been put forth or even a speculative projection could have resulted in the article getting more interested. Although the point to be kept in mind is that the narrative is being analized from a design and storytelling point of view and not through the journalism lens.</p>
