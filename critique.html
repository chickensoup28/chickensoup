    <h2>Purpose and objective</h2>
        <P>The purpose of this visualization is to make the people of United States of America understand the impacts of lockdown and social distancing. To show how the country was impacted the article focuses on the jobs that people lost during this time and compares it to relative large scale events to paint clearer pictures.
        </P>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <P>The article is made for the people of America and it is for them to understand contextualise how grave and serious the issue is hence the comparative measures/units used in the visualisation are events etched in the memory of the people.
        </P>
        
        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <P>The visual language is clean and simple, elements of the bar graph have been used as a tool to convey and project the measure of seriousness of the issue. The highlight color 'Red' is chosen aptly to highlight important parts and draw attention of the reader towards them. Navigating to the visualizations further down in the scroll there is use of a line graph that provides even more persepective.  
        </P>
        <p>Once the overview of the narrative is done we move to details on demand. Here the data is broken down and simple use of glyphs to represent people and population is used. Comparative area covered is used to contextualise how much a sector has been affected. The same visual style is carried forward to the rest of the visualisations only with refernce to a unit figure. This is done to provide comparative analysis between equal qantitites.</p>

        <h3>INTERACTION AND NARRATIVE DESIGN</h3>
    

        <h3>AESTHETIC AND QUALITY OF DESIGN</h3>
        <P>The overall black and white theme suits the topic well. There is no unncecessary details added in any of the visualisations used and only shows what is needed to tell the story right. The graph in itself is very minimal with only two enties in y axis for 20% and 40%. There does not seem to be any innovation
            int he design and pretty much follows the style as seen in many works by reuters.
        </P>

        <h3>WHAT IF</h3>
        <P>All this analysis brings us to the question of what could have been better or what would you do differently. Althought the minimal design suits the theme and helps in bringing just the right amount of information to the user, I would have liked to play with the visualisation a bit more, may be by checking India's projection 
            or highlighting the other lines to see more details on that country. So, adding a county wise filter and and option to hightlight on hover would have been better.
            </P>
        <p>
        The second visualisation for showing the change in male and female population over time is kept as a video and cannot be controlled. A slider here to check the details would have added value to readers who are interested in the topic.
